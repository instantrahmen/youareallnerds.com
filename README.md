# You are all nerds

But if you're reading this that must mean you're some sort of super nerd? Wow.

Anyway this is a super low effort joke website created with React for some of my friends. It's mostly still just CRA boilerplate because I'm too lazy to put real effort into this.

If you have any ideas to improve it, feel free to submit a PR. ðŸ’™
